## What should be done

1. Need to finish developing the searchbar
2. Need to work on how to template the popup html file
3. Maybe for the origin, save the html file and bring it up
4. Made a child template, "map_page.html", which is a new way of bringing the map. could be used 
for relocating the map. (need to think of a create way)
5. Develop a function that filters the map depending on the search result, making a cluster around the search area so that we don't have to make pop up table for areas that is not in the search area ( use the pandas filter function)
